# Advent of Code 2025

This is my solutions to all 12 days of Advent of Code 2025.  You can use this code to test your inputs by replacing the input files located in ```/src/inputs```.

> [!NOTE]
> My day 9 solution runs very slow (>2 min)

> [!NOTE]
> My day 12 solution is not a general solution but works because of the restraints put in all inputs.  When running ```zig build test``` the day 12 test will skip.

You can then run the code using the following command:

```zig
zig build run
```

You can also utilize each days solution by importing the module into your own project.
